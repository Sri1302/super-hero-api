# super-hero-api


ğŸŒŸ SuperHeroğŸ¦¸App ğŸŒŸ:You can search your favorite SuperHero and Know their powerstats && and also generate Random SuperHeros.

In this project I used "superhero.api" API which contains data and information about a list of superheroes from the comic universe. This includes their physical capabilities, biography information, occupations, power statistics, connections with other heroes, and appearances in movies.
and used concepts like:
ğŸ‘‰Fetch()
ğŸ‘‰Template Literals
ğŸ‘‰Higher Order Functions
ğŸ‘‰Event Listeners
ğŸ‘‰Dom Manipulation .etc

It is very organised and easy to Understand.
